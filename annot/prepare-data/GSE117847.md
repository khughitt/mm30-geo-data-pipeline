**Gene ID mapping**

When mapping from probes to gene symbols via Ensembl gene identifiers, more of
the genes map to GRCh38 than to GRCh37.

A total 57/53538 of the genes could not be mapped to a gene symbol, using the mappings from [Annotables](https://github.com/stephenturner/annotables).

Some of these appear to be associated with ensgene identifiers found in GRCh37:

For now, these will simply be excluded from the analysis.

**External patiential metadata**

One of the publications associated with the dataset includes a table with additional information about _some_ of the patients in this dataset (Storti et al., 2019; table 1a).

The table includes some demographics information (age, sex), and also some information about CRAB symptoms, etc.

Unfortunately, the patient metadata is limited to the SMM samples, and, while the identifiers appear to follow a similar convention, it is not completely clear how to map from patients in the GEO metadata to those in the manuscript table.

As such, this is being left out for now.

In the future, if there is interest, it may be worth reaching out to authors to see see if data is available for all patients, and how to map between the identifiers used in the different tables.
