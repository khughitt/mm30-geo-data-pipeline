GSE106218 Notes
===============

- expression data is missing from `ExpressionSet` returned by call to `getGEO()`, and
  instead, has to be downloaded separately using `getGEOSuppFiles()`
- similarly, some useful clinical metadata is not available via `pData()`, and is
  instead downloaded as a supplemental file.
- expression data is already TPM normalized, so no further adjustments are needed
- the provided TPM counts appear to be based off of GRCh37; in order to be consistent
  with other datasets, the symbols are updated to GRCh38, where possible.
- GSE106218 contains scRNA-Seq data; for the purposes of this analysis, we are
  interested in comparing bulk expression estimates, and as such, the individual samples
  are aggregated for each patient.
