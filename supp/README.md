GEO Supplemental Data Files
===========================

Overview
--------

Original/cleaned versions of supplemental files available for some of the datasets.

For now, only files which are publicly-accessible on GEO are included in the Git repo;
for other files downloaded from manuscripts, links to the relevant papers are listed.
Files may be added at a future date to improve reproducibility.
