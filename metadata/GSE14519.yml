  description: "We used microarrays to examine changes in gene expression in multiple myeloma cell lines following treatment with arsenic trioxide and darinaparsin"
  design: "Four multiple myeloma cell lines (U266, MM.1s, KMS11, 8226/S) were treated with either arsenic trioxide (ATO) for 6, 24, or 48 hours or darinaparsin (DAR) for 6 or 24 hours; RNA was extracted from treated and control cells for microarray analysis"
