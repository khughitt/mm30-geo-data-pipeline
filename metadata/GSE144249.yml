    description: "	RNA was extracted from myeloma cell lines that were either drug-naïve or resistant to bortezomib or carfilzomib and the transcriptome was characterised using RNA sequencing."
    design: "5TGM1 or RPMI-8226 cells were cultured in increasing concentrations of bortezomib (for bortezomib-resistant) or carfilzomib (for carfilzomib resistant) over a period of several months in order to generate resistant cell lines. Resistant cell lines were given a drug holiday for 5 days prior to RNA extraction. RNA was extracted from 1x10^7 cells per sample using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit and RNA-seq was performed."
