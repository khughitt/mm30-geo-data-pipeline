    description: "Multiple myeloma is a relatively common B-cell malignancy that is currently incurable. Certain recurrent genetic abnormalities characteristics of different genetic subtypes have been described. Hyperdiploid myeloma characterized by recurrent trisomies is the most common genetic subtypes. However little is know about it's biology. Another common genetic abnormality is chromosome 13 deletion which is also associated with inferior prognosis. This abnormality is already present at the pre-malignant MGUS stage and is clonally selected with disease progression. Although it is biologically and clinically important the molecular consequence of chromosome 13 deletion is unknown."
    design: "Hyperdiploid myeloma was identified using FISH. The gene expression profile of hyperdiploid MM is compared to that of non-hyperdiploid myeloma to identify differentially expressed genes. Molecular heterogeneity within H-MM is analyzed using unsupervised techniques. The distinctive subgroups identified are also tested in MGUS/SMM and NH-MM. The clinical relevance of these subtypes of hyperdiploid myeloma is then analyzed by correlating with relevant clinical information. Chromosome 13 deleted and undeleted MM are identified by FISH and their gene expression profile compared to identify molecular signature."
